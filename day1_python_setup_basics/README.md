# Day 1 -- Python Setup & Core Basics

This day focuses on setting up a professional Python development
environment and learning Python core fundamentals.

## Training Scope

We started training on two tracks: - **Python** for Backend - **React**
for Frontend

This repository covers the Python track.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Was Covered

### Python Setup & Environment

-   Installed Python from the official source
-   Installed `pipx` for managing global Python tools
-   Created and used virtual environments (`venv`)
-   Installed and used:
    -   `flake8` for linting
    -   `black` for code formatting

### Git Basics

-   Initialized a Git repository
-   Created commits
-   Pushed code to GitHub

### Python Core Concepts

-   Python execution model and bytecode (high-level understanding)
-   Indentation rules and syntax basics
-   Primitive data types:
    -   `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`
-   Type casting between primitive types
-   Introduction to type hints

Example:

``` python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hands-on Task

-   Created GitHub repository: `python-training`
-   Implemented `profile.py` script that:
    -   Reads CLI arguments using `sys.argv`
    -   Prints a formatted profile card
-   Ran `flake8` and `black`
-   Committed the cleaned and formatted code

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Outcome

By the end of Day 1, a clean Python environment was set up and basic
Python syntax, structure, and tooling were clearly understood.
