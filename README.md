# Python Training

This repository is part of an ongoing **training program** focused on
building strong foundations in **Python for Backend development**,
alongside React for Frontend (handled separately).

The goal of this repository is to track my **daily progress**, practical
exercises, and hands-on tasks throughout the Python training.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Training Overview

During this training, I am working on:

-   Python environment setup and tooling
-   Core Python fundamentals
-   Writing clean, readable, and production-ready code
-   Applying best practices such as linting, formatting, and testing
-   Using Git and GitHub for version control and progress tracking

Each training day is organized into its own folder and includes: 
- Code implementations 
- Practice tasks 
- A README explaining what was covered that day

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📁 Repository Structure

    python-training/
    ├── day1_python_setup_basics/
    ├── day2_control_flow_testing/
    ├── ...
    └── README.md

New folders will be added continuously as the training progresses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Workflow

For each training day, I: 
1. Study the assigned concepts 
2. Implement hands-on tasks and exercises 
3. Run code quality tools when applicable
4. Write or update documentation 
5. Commit and push progress to GitHub

This ensures steady progress and clear documentation of learning
outcomes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as: 
- A learning log of my Python training journey 
- A reference for reviewed and tested Python code 
- A showcase of consistent progress and best practices

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📝 Notes

-   Code is written incrementally and may evolve over time.
-   Each day builds on previous concepts.
-   Feedback and reviews are welcome.
